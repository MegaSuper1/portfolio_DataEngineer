## ðŸ§¾ Legacy Report Automation and BI Modernization

**Company:** FedEx Supply Chain / Genco Logistics  
**Role:** BI Developer / Report Automation Specialist  
**Tools:** Microsoft Access, Excel VBA, QlikView, Windows Task Scheduler, Postman  
**Skills:** Process automation, legacy system migration, API integration, batch scripting, stakeholder collaboration, cost reduction

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

FedEx Supply Chain relied on manually generated Excel-based reports sourced from MercuryGate, consuming substantial time and resources. These processes required full-time associates to manually run and compile reports each week, introducing risk and inefficiency.

My responsibility was to design and implement a fully automated reporting system using Microsoft Access, VBA, and batch scripting, with long-term migration to QlikView for enterprise reporting.

## ðŸ“Œ Responsibilities

- **Automated MercuryGate report generation** via batch scripting and REST API calls  
- **Integrated Microsoft Access and Excel** to build logic-driven data workflows and output formatted Excel reports  
- **Used VBA macros** to export, pivot, and visualize data within Excel automatically  
- **Implemented scheduled automation** via Windows Task Scheduler to eliminate manual involvement  
- **Collaborated with stakeholders** to gather requirements, prioritize use cases, and ensure compliance with operational KPIs  
- **Planned BI modernization strategy** for transitioning to QlikView and phasing out Excel-based legacy reporting
