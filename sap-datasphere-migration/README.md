# 📊 SAP Datasphere Cloud Migration

**Company:** Tessco Enterprises  
**Role:** Project Lead / Data Engineer  
**Tools:** SAP Datasphere, SAP HANA, SAP BODS, Power BI  
**Skills:** Cloud architecture, data pipeline design, semantic model replication, SQL optimization, project management

## 🔧 Project Overview

Tessco Enterprises initiated this migration to modernize its enterprise reporting stack, improve scalability, reduce ETL overhead, and enable governed self-service analytics across business domains such as finance, operations, and sales.  Cloud replacement for SAP Hana Sidecar and SAP DataServices (BODS).

This project involved leading the migration of key enterprise data and semantic models from an on-premise SAP HANA environment to the SAP Datasphere cloud platform. The effort was not simply a lift-and-shift exercise — it was designed to modernize and enhance the enterprise BI architecture, promote reuse, and enable cloud-native scalability.
