## 🔧 Project Overview

Ferguson Enterprises needed a scalable, secure HR analytics architecture to enable strategic workforce planning and identify emerging risks across departments. The solution required reusable components, governed data access, and the ability to support complex analysis with minimal overhead.

I led the design and implementation of a robust Power BI solution that integrated key HR data domains and provided a flexible foundation for long-term analytics initiatives. I also secured buy-in from HR leadership by articulating how the architecture would reduce time-to-insight while strengthening governance.
